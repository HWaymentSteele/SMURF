# SSW-and-GRUMLIN

laxy.py: wrapper around JAX for basic neural networks, see https://github.com/sokrypton/laxy

sw_functions.py: differentiable JAX implementations of smooth Smith Waterman 

network_functions.py: GRUMLIN pipeline; BasicAlign is the "MSA" module that we use to align the sequences and MRF is the "GRUMLIN" part 

test_method.py: code I am using to run a hyperparameter search; should give an idea of how to initialize and train the networks
